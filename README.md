## #Project Overview 📋
The Food Track Canada project is an in-depth analysis and prediction task focused on retail food prices. We've harnessed data from various sources, performed exploratory data analysis, and built a predictive model to forecast food prices.

## #Data Extraction 🛠️
We began by extracting red meat data from the Agri Canada website. This initial step provided us with a robust dataset that set the stage for our subsequent analyses.

## #Data Discovery and Preprocessing 🔍📝
After obtaining the data, we transformed it into a format suitable for analysis in Jupyter Notebook. New CSV files were created to ensure readability and compatibility with our tools.

## #Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 🕵️‍♂️📈
The EDA phase allowed us to dive deep into the characteristics of the red meat data, resulting in insightful visualizations that revealed trends and patterns.

## #Data Acquisition and Further EDA 🥗➕
We incorporated additional data on retail prices of various food products from 1995 to 2022. This data underwent a similar EDA process to understand its intricacies.

## #Data Preprocessing and Model Training 🖥️👩‍🔬
The data was then preprocessed, with categorical variables being hard-coded. A decision tree model was trained using data from before 2020 and tested on data from after 2020.

## #Model Performance Summary 📊💡
Our model's effectiveness was assessed using several metrics:

RMSE: 0.3292
MAE: 0.2171
R-squared: 0.9712
These metrics indicate a high level of accuracy and reliability in our model's predictions.

## #Predictions for 2023 🚀🔮
Predictions for the year 2023 were made and stored in a DataFrame. We visualized these predictions to compare them with historical prices, as shown in this images.

## #Interactive Dashboard 🖥️🤹
An interactive dashboard was created in Tableau, featuring an item list that allows users to view the predicted and actual prices of selected items, along with their score positions.
